Steps to import git repo AND create new project:

1. have a repo ready to clone
- clone repo into a folder, and keep track of its FILEPATH

2. open Eclipse in your Workspace
- use the working space of Coolb/Documents/GitHub on desktop
- use the working space of faijwefiuu/GitHub on laptop

3. Create a new Java Project, titled "MonthDay_Year_Filename"
- month is usually 3-letter abbr
- year is usually 4 digits
- filename is usually project-related

4. open files
- navigate to the GitHub folder

5. Move project folder from GitHub to repo FILEPATH

6. go back to eclipse

7. delete project from **JUST** the workspace
- ==DO NOT DELETE FROM DISK==
- **will probably throw 'file not found' error > hit 'continue'**

7. File > import

8. Git > Projects from Git

9. Existing local repository

10. If repo not already added > Add
a) Browse to GitHub folder
b) select the repos u wanna pull from > Add

11. select the repo u wanna pull from > Next

12. Import existing Eclipse projects > Next > select the project(s) to import > Finish

15. continue like you would. all changes sync with the Github repo. 
As long as you commit and push, then your work gets upploaded too
